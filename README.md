1. Mix (default at startup)
1. Drumpads
1. Devices
1. Edit
1. Solo/Mute
1. Arm
1. Select
1. Cut/Copy


Loop button works as shift button.  It is used in the following ways:

1. with grid pads (hold Loop_btn + press on grid pad, and if it is clip there, it will be deleted/ if it was not then Empty clip will be created in the current slot
2. with rec_btn: it will rec just as usual.
3. will be described below.


#### Mix
Main grid in mix mode has two rows i.e. 16 pads. You can create, record, start, stop, and delete clips by pushing pads.

Round buttons (RB) launch/stop the whole scene.

Move grid using the forward/backward navigation buttons (forward/backward buttons in 6-button group on the right of the keyboard).

Rec button starts metronome and overdub in clips.

##### Pad Colors
* solid green - currently playing
* blinking green - will play (or stop playing) on next transition
  * press again to stop playing
* solid yellow - available to play
  * delete clip with Loop+Pad
* solid red - recording
* blinking white - available to record

#### Drumpads
Enabled when bottom inControl button is off.

#### Devices
Manage with device section. Starts on press fader button 1 (fb1).

First row of grid pad - remote control's pages.
Second row of grid pad - select device (up to 8)

* add first device - rb1
* change device - rb1
* add additional device after first - Loop+rb1
* delete device - rb2 (sometimes buggy)

Knobs manage remote_control's parameters.

Rb2 deletes current device (but it still work not ok, sometimes it doesn't delete[only after selecting a device with mouse in the bitwig it begin to work. Also such a problem happens when you try to delete track or copy, cut clip using launchkey. The problem is connected with selection. For example, if you want to delete clip via keyboard, and  track is displayed in inspector in bitwig, then track will be deleted. I still don't know how appropreate make bitwig to change selection correctly though i searched through all the API to find the answer and tried to use any of avaliable functions. I will be glad if you share your guesswork with me])

#### Edit
