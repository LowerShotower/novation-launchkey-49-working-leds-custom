# novation-launchkey-49-working-leds-custom (API 2)
novation launchkey 49 working leds knobs and sliders, buttons.  All works a little bit different from original ableton or bitwig scripts.
Main grid in mix mode has two rows i.e. 16 pads. You can rec, start,stop clips by pushing pads. Round buttons (RB) launch/stop the whole scene. Nav buttons move grid.  Rec button starts metronome and overdub in clips.  In my approach loop button works as shift button.  It is used : 1) with grid pads (hold Loop_btn + press on grid pad, and if it is clip there, it will be deleted 2) with rec_btn: it will rec just as usual. 3) will be described below.
To change controllers behaviour i use several modes: Mix, Drumpads, Device, Cut, Copy, Edit, Solo, Mute, Arm, Select.
Mix: simple grid to launch, stop, rec, del clips. Used from start.
Drumpads: simple drumpads for drumming. On as inControk_pad_button is pressed.
